# Arduino Powered Plant Watering System
This is an Arduino based Plant watering system that uses a soil moisture sensor
to monitor the garden soil and automatically water the plants when the moisture
level falls below a threshold value. The minimum moisture level can be set using
a Potentiometer.

## Components
- Arduino
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Potentiometer
- Relay Module
- Water pump or solenoid valve(depends on the water supply available)
